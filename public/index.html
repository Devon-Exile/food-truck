<!--FRONT END-->
<!--Handle building application HTML and displaying menu/events etc...-->

<!--I have a couple comments in the index (here), site.css, site.js, and static.js-->
<!--I think these are the only spots the front end has to deal with-->
<!--I think I've kinda got a flow of what the front end should be commented out but I'm not 100%-->
